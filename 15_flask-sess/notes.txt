#K15: Sessions Greetings: Flask app that uses session capabilities to allow a user to login and logout.
#Due Dec 14 2020
 We used session.pop() to end sessions, but maybe it's possible to replace the session instead of popping it?
 Learned to make a route for a specific logout button, return to login page with successful logout message
 Struggled a lot with making the logout button, first used <submit>, then <logout>, then changed to <form> with an input like in the login.html file
 Used value to display a specific name for input button
 name does not change the name displayed, still displayed submit
 Session remembers your login data even when you close the page (super satisfying to see we were still logged in)
 Will want to delete login error messages for future use/projects, but good to have for debugging
 Why do we need a secret key? How does it work?
 Possibilities to expand to a database instead of hard-coded username and password, possible use for DigitalOcean droplets or MongoDB
