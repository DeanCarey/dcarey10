K28 -- Bubble Bubble Toil Trouble
2021-05-11

For demo 1, only 1 pop-up is displayed and it tells the user the contents of the cell that the user clicked on.
The third argument of the addEventListener() statement isn't specified, so the browser uses the bubbling phase.

For demo 2, the pop-ups moving from the inner-most elements to the outer-most elements is the bubbling phase. 
First, the pop-up shows the contents of the cell that the user clicked on. Then, the browser moves on to the next immediate ancestor 
element and the pop-up displays the HTML tags in the <tr> element containing the cell that the user clicked on. The browser continues 
moving to ancestor elements until it reaches the <table> element. 

If e.stopPropagation() isn't called in demo 3, the pop-ups move from the elements in <table> to the contents of the cell that 
the user clicked on and then outwards to the <tr> element that the cell the user clicked on is in. Moving from the elements 
in <table> to the <td> element (cell) is the capturing phase while moving from the cell to the <tr> element (row) is bubbling phase. 

e.stopPropagation() prevents further propagation of the current event in the capturing and bubbling phases. However, if 
the user clicks on a cell in the table, one pop-up still shows up in the browser because clicks on elements are still processed.

The order that the event listeners in demo 4 is the same as the order of event listeners in demo 3, so the order in which the 
event listeners are attached does not matter. The variable that determines whether the browser uses bubbling or capturing phase 
is the third argument of addEventListener(). If the third variable is true, the capturing phase is used. If there isn't a third 
argument, the bubbling phase is used.
	-In demo 3, only addEventListener() of <table> has the third argument set to true. The HTML tags in the <table> tags are 
	shown in the first pop-up since <table> is the outermost element in demo 3 that has an event listener.
	-In demo 4, all of the addEventListener() statements had their third arguments set to true. Thus, the browser uses 
	the capturing phase: the first pop-up shows the HTML tags in <table>, the next pop-up shows those in <tr>, and the last
	pop-up shows those in <td>.
