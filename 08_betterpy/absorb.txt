We really like Team Ethan and Dean because they were able to do it by reading the documentation and it was an efficient and concise code.
Everyone else created a dicitonary by parsing therough the csv file but their group were able to do it by using a method they found in the
csv library. We also took a look at Team Window 9's because they were able to accomplish the task only using random. In addition, they were
able to read the csv file and print out an occupation using an algorithm they made and print out an occupation using an algorithm they
made. Our only comment is that their program was a bit lacking in terms of documentation.
