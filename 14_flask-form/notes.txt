#K14: Form and Function: Flask app to echo user input via HTML
#Due Dec 10 2020 

> request.form does not work in authenticate(), so we need to use request.args for the username value
> request.method gets you the type of method (GET, POST)
> restricting methods to 'POST' gives us "Method not allowed" printed on the response page (even if we change request.args to request.form).
> can't test POST, the form/response only works with GET with what we have.

print(app)
    expected output: the name of the app
    actual output: <Flask 'app'>
print(request.method)
    expected output: GET
    actual output: GET
print(request.args)
    expected output: dictionary of the form's keys and values based on query string
    actual output: ImmutableMultiDict([('username', 'hello'), ('sub1', 'Submit')])
print(request.form)
    expected output: ImmutableMultiDict([('username', 'hello'), ('sub1', 'Submit')])
    actual output: ImmutableMultiDict([])
print(request.headers)
    expected output: thought it would print out headers from the browser (as we learned in class)
    actual output: information about the browser like Host, Connection, language, etc.
