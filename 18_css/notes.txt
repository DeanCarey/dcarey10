OUR NOTES:
First off, inline CSS is REALLY tedious. Nobody should use it.
Also, w3schools is amazing as always - we were able to edit a template of theirs to see what style element was messing up our CSS!
Overall, we refreshed our knowledge of divs, and then we got to sigh in relief as WAY TOO MUCH TIME -> a lil bit of time -> just 2 secs between versions.

HOW2CSS:
Inline - In an HTML tag, put in style="" to start adding things. All the CSS pairs go in between the quotation marks!
Internal - In the head region, use the <style> tags to demarcate an area that basically acts like a built in stylesheet. Much faster than inline, and much easier to edit.
External - Create a .css file, and link to it in the head of the HTML file. Allows you to apply the same styling to multiple pages, and is just COOL :)
