K08 -- Cross Pollination and Virtual Insanity/Learn what python virtual environments do and how we as a software
2020-10-03


`python3 -m venv' is a command that tells python to run a virtual environment script. What the script allows the user to do is to create a
new workspace that contains a new python binary that has no external modules in place. The name of the workspace is given by the argument
after venv, '~/myherozero'. However, just because the user runs the command doesn't mean the environment is activated. Instead, the user
must run the command `source ~/myherozero/bin/activate`. This will start the virtual environment and to be deactivated, the user simply
runs the command `deactivate`. In addition, since this workspace is fresh, there will be no external library transferred from your overall
system. The benefits of the environment are clear: to make sure your project has only the libraries it requires. A user can then mess
around separately from multiple projects to create and make sure their project does not become overwhelmed with additional unnecessary resources.
